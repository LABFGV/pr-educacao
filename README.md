## Políticas Públicas de Educação e Regulação do Ensino Básico no Rio de Janeiro 

This project is being developed by [LAB.ipp](https://github.com/LABFGV), a organization of students form FGV-Rio who believes that, with great evidence, we can improve the public sector; and prof. Carlos Ragazzo, our partner of [Todos pela Educação](https://www.todospelaeducacao.org.br). 

Our goal is to **identify the singularities and issues in municipal schools of Rio de Janeiro over the years**, crossing data from the oficial indicator of performance, [IDEB](http://portal.inep.gov.br/ideb), other socioconomics indicators and laws governing municipal education.

### About the research

### Results

To see the map with IDEB marks from all municipal school in Rio, you cana open the file `ideb_kepler.json` on [kepler.gl](https://kepler.gl) (the data goes from 2005 until 2017).
