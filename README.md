## Políticas Públicas de Educação e Regulação do Ensino Básico no Rio de Janeiro 

This project is being developed by [LAB.ipp](https://github.com/LABFGV), a organization of students form FGV-Rio who believes that, with great evidence, we can improve the public sector; and prof. Carlos Ragazzo, our partner of [Todos pela Educação](https://www.todospelaeducacao.org.br). 

Our goal is to **identify the singularities and issues in municipal schools of Rio de Janeiro over the years**, crossing data from the oficial indicator of performance, [IDEB](http://portal.inep.gov.br/ideb), other socioconomics indicators and laws governing municipal education.
